2- Import the sql file, you have two files: seer.sql which contains all the tables and DATA (dumped data), and seer-t.sql which contains only the structure of tables (fresh start). PS: you need to create an admin account if you want to install a fresh start "INSERT INTO users (uid, username, email, password, user_type) VALUES (1, 'admin', 'test@example.com', '$2y$10$h.pITHRu3yndKnmcb9454O38vRbs.JhjMUZ0zWRc0WMjFHazlLmmi', 'admin');" (Password is: 123456789)
